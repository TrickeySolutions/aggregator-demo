# Cyber Insurance Quote Platform

A demonstration web application for generating cyber insurance quotes, built using Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects. The application follows the GOV.UK Design System for a consistent and accessible user experience.  It can be used to demonstrate some architecture patterns and features of Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Cloudflare Workers account (https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers)
- Wrangler CLI (https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

## Quick Start

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTrickeySolutions%2Faggregator-demo)

The Deploy to Cloudflare button will automatically:
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect it to Cloudflare Builds
3. Start the initial deployment

After clicking the button, you'll need to:

### 1. Set up Required Cloudflare Services

#### Create Cloudflare Queues
```bash
npx wrangler queues create activity-submission
npx wrangler queues create partner-quotes
npx wrangler queues create activity-submission-dlq
npx wrangler queues create partner-quotes-dlq
```

#### Create R2 Bucket
```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create partner-logos
npx wrangler r2 bucket create partner-logos-dev
```

#### Set up Cloudflare AI Gateway
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > AI
2. Create a new AI Gateway named `aggregator-demo-gateway`
3. Note down the Gateway ID

#### Set up Cloudflare Turnstile
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > Security > Turnstile
2. Create a new site widget
3. Note down the Site Key and Secret Key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with the following variables:
```
TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
PARTNER_LOGOS_URL=your_r2_bucket_url
```

For production, add these variables in your Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Go to Workers & Pages
2. Select your application
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add the same variables as above

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up GOV.UK Frontend assets:
```bash
npm run setup-govuk
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

```

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Get a Quote" on the home page
2. System creates new customer and activity
3. User completes multi-step quote form
4. On submission:
   - Form data is saved
   - Partner quote requests are queued
   - User is redirected to results page
   - Partners process quote requests asynchronously
   - Results update in real-time as quotes arrive

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Durable Objects for persistent state management
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Queue-based processing for partner integrations
- TypeScript for type safety
- Error handling and timeout management
- Activity state machine (draft â†’ processing â†’ getting_quotes â†’ completed)

## Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

1. Verify all Cloudflare services are properly created and configured
2. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Cloudflare account has access to all required services (Workers, R2, AI Gateway, etc.)
4. Check the Workers logs in the Cloudflare Dashboard for any error messages
