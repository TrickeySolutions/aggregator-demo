# Cyber Insurance Quote Platform

A demonstration web application for a cyber insurance comparison service.
 
It can be used to demonstrate a wide variety Cloudflare developer platform features 
At the core of this application is a fan-in fan-out architecture that scatters the risk profiles to many potential insruance prviders and then gatehrs the results for aggregation.
The applciation also leverages AI inference to genreate

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Get a Quote" on the home page
2. System creates new customer and activity
3. User completes multi-step quote form
4. On submission:
   - Form data is saved - user is redirected to a results page
   - Users activity profile is asynch sent to AI Generated Partners
   - Partners process activities requests asynchronously and offer quotes
   - Quote Results are aggregated in real-time as as they arrive
5. User can compare offers to choose which quote to accept

## Features

- Multi-step quote generation process
- Real-time form validation and state synchronization
- Persistent state management
- Progress tracking
- Asynchronous quote processing with multiple partners
- Real-time quote status updates
- Auto-save draft functionality
- Session management
- Activity timeout handling
- Responsive design
- Accessible interface

## Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- GOV.UK Design System

## Prerequisites

- Cloudflare Workers account (https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers)

<details>
<summary>Optional: Local Development Prereqisites}</summary>

If you want to develop locally or manage resources via command line, you'll also need:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Wrangler CLI (https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

</details>

## Quick Start

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTrickeySolutions%2Faggregator-demo)

The Deploy to Cloudflare button will automatically:
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect it to Cloudflare Builds
3. Start the initial deployment
4. Provision primatives as resources (Queues, Object Storage, AI Inferance, Durable Objects etc..)

> **Note**: When using the Deploy button, all required Cloudflare resources are automatically provisioned for you. You only need to configure environment variables after deployment.

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.dev.vars` file in your project root with the following variables:
```
TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
PARTNER_LOGOS_URL=your_r2_bucket_url
```

For production, you can set the variables either through the Dashboard UI or using wrangler commands:

```bash
# Using wrangler to set secrets
wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
wrangler secret put PARTNER_LOGOS_URL
```

Alternatively, via the Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Go to Workers & Pages
2. Select your application
3. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add the same variables as above

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the project manually instead of using the Deploy button, you'll need to create the following resources yourself:

#### Create Cloudflare Queues
```bash
npx wrangler queues create activity-submission
npx wrangler queues create partner-quotes
npx wrangler queues create activity-submission-dlq
npx wrangler queues create partner-quotes-dlq
```

#### Create R2 Bucket
```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create partner-logos
npx wrangler r2 bucket create partner-logos-dev
```

#### Set up Cloudflare AI Gateway
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > AI
2. Create a new AI Gateway named `aggregator-demo-gateway`
3. Note down the Gateway ID

#### Set up Cloudflare Turnstile
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard > Security > Turnstile
2. Create a new site widget
3. Note down the Site Key and Secret Key

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up GOV.UK Frontend assets:
```bash
npm run setup-govuk
```

3. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Get a Quote" on the home page
2. System creates new customer and activity
3. User completes multi-step quote form
4. On submission:
   - Form data is saved - user is redirected to a results page
   - Users activity profile is asynch sent to AI Generated Partners
   - Partners process activities requests asynchronously and offer quotes
   - Quote Results are aggregated in real-time as as they arrive
5. User can compare offers to choose which quote to accept

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Durable Objects for persistent state management
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Queue-based processing for partner integrations
- TypeScript for type safety
- Error handling and timeout management
- Activity state machine (draft â†’ processing â†’ getting_quotes â†’ completed)

## Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

1. Verify all Cloudflare services are properly created and configured
2. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Cloudflare account has access to all required services (Workers, R2, AI Gateway, etc.)
4. Check the Workers logs in the Cloudflare Dashboard for any error messages
