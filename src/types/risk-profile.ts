/**
 * Risk Profile Type Definitions
 * 
 * TODO: These types are currently not in use but are intended for future implementation to:
 * - Add type safety to form data collection and validation
 * - Implement structured risk scoring and assessment
 * - Enforce consistent data shape for partner quote processing
 * - Provide better TypeScript support for activity state management
 * 
 * Implementation Plan:
 * 1. Update ActivityState interface to use these types for formData
 * 2. Add runtime validation using these interfaces
 * 3. Implement risk scoring based on SecurityPosture and IncidentHistory
 * 4. Type partner quote responses using these interfaces
 * 5. Add form validation against these type definitions
 * 
 * Defines the structure for risk assessment and profile calculation
